# Vending_Machine
The Vending Machine is an automatic machine that sells food and drinks.
I have designed a vending machine FSM(Finite State Machine) using verilog HDL language.
First file is specifying the mechanism of machine.
Second file is a testbench of first file.
Third file is a dumpfile which shows gtkwave output.
